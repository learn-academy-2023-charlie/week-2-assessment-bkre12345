# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

## 1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: 
    A parameter is a variable that is part of a function, while an argument is the value passed into the function.

Researched answer: 
    Parameters are part of a function's definition and are used as placeholders for the actual values that are passed in, while arguments are the actual values that are passed into a function when called.

## 2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer:
    The .map() method requires a function that is used to transform an element in an array. The optional parameters are arrays and index. 

Researched answer:
    The .map() method requires having the value of the current element needed to process through the function in the array. It can optionally take an index and array.

## 3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: 
    .map() is used to recall the numbers inside an array and does not alter the original, while .filter() is used to pass through an array and separates out what is needed when returned.

Researched answer:
    .map() takes a function as an argument and transforms each element of an array and returns a new array with the same length, while .filter() takes a function as an argument, tests each element of an array, but only returns the elements that pass its test in the a new array

## 4. What is iteration?

Your answer: 
    A process that repeats and repeats until the conditions is met

Researched answer:
    Iteration refers to the process of repeatedly executing blocks of code or functions over a set of elements.

## 5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: 
    Functions are used to take in arguments and returns values, while methods are a type of function used to change something

Researched answer:
    A function is a block of code that performs specific tasks that could be called on anywhere in the code. It takes arguments and returns values and can be used on larger pieces of code to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. 
    A method is a function associated with objects or classes. It can manipulate the objects' data or perform actions related to the object.

## 6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer:
    Hoisting is the process of moving codes to the top.

Researched answer:
    Hoisting in JavaScript is moving variables and functions to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase before executing the code.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability

# 1. Component:
    It typically refers to the definition of a reusable pieces of code to represent a specific piece of functionality or element within an applicatiion

# 2. Spread operator:
    A syntax feature that allows expansions of iterables (arrays or strings) into individual elements and often denoted by three dots (...)

# 3. React state:
    A fundamental concept that allows devs to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces that respond to user interactions in real-time. It stores dynamic datas of components and renders the content of these components in response to user actions, server responses, and other types of input

# 4. React props:
    A key feature of React that allows components to transfer from a parent to child components and can be customized and reused

# 5. DOM events:
    Refers to the actions that occur on web pages that are detected by the DOM (Document Object Model) and triggers certain actions or behaviors in a web application. (Mouse clicks, keyboard inputs)
